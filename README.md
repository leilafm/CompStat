## What is CompareStat?

CompareStat is an application that allows **users to upload and compare** information regarding American Football players. Player information that can be uploaded may include personal details (age, birth date, or hometown), player position, player team, a photo of the player, and/or player statistics. Once this information is uploaded to the application, the user can compare any of this data with other players that have previously been uploaded by themselves or others that have used the application. 

This project is of interest to me because I love watching American football, but it is extremely hard to find a way to compare players by their unique attributes, so I hope to make an application that can do that. This application will be used by the following groups:  
- Football journalists and reporters who seek to report on the most up-to-date player statistics and comparisons  
- Football gamblers who seek to follow the trends to make the best decisions for their bets
- Football enthusiasts who enjoy spending time learning about players and teams
